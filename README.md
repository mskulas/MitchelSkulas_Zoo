AI Reflection:
Again, I didn't prompt copilot to write my code, I only used it for javadoc comments after the fact.
The autocomplete worked well most of the time (even predicted that I would make a particular joke), although I had to edit it when implementing interfaces.
Most of the code was human-written though, so there was not much to edit.
